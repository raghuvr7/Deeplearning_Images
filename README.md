Business Problem:

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

What is the dataset that is being used? CNN Assignment

Conclusions
Augmentation highly helped in terms of accurate predictions initially without the dropouts and all the training accuracy was much deviated from that of the validation accuracy. On applying Augmentation the class balancing helped us reduce this much further and gave us the best output required.
